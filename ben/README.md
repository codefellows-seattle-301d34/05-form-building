## Overview

This is a blogging application that automatically sorts articles by publication date and allows users to add new articles without touching HTML.

## Getting Started

The user would need to go to a git repository containing the application. They would fork the application into their own git hub account. They would then clone down the github repository they forked in a git bash terminal. They could copy the starter code into their own file. Once they have a working copy of the code they can begin to customize the app to their needs.

## Architecture

**Languages Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.  
**Libraries Used**: JQuery, Handlebars
  
CSS is organized using SMACSS guidelines.  
Written with Visual Studio Code.

## Change Log

05-20-2018 3:50PM - Implemented form event handling on new.html.
