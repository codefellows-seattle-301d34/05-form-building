**Author**: Andrew Peacock
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
My problem domain was to create a live updater for a blog website, so that a user could create a new article instance, append it to the dom, and preview it as they typed it without having to ever touch the javascript/html functionalities. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
If you want to make this app, you must get familiar with Handlebar.JS, jQuery, and vanilla JS. You'll need to create several .js files and two html files, and weave them together- some of the organization I used was to have a single page to host the array of Article instances so that it didn't clutter up the main js page, then push those into empty arrays elsewhere. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
I used handlebar.js, jQuery, vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, lorempixel.com

## Change Log
